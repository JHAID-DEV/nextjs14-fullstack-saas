# [Next 13 starters with authentication and database set up](https://saasyland.com)

Starter templates for Next.js 13 full-stack projects. Built with Tailwind CSS, ShadCn, authentication, and database. Several branches contain several different configurations, including serverless databases like PostgreSQL with Neon, or MySQL with PlanetScale, Drizzle ORM, Prisma ORM v.5 (serverless-compatible), but also MongoDB and Supabase.

**The project is currently under active development and is not ready for production use. Please check back soon**

## Available branches:

- ### [baseline](https://github.com/pjborowiecki/SAASY-LAND-Next-13-Starters-With-Authentication-And-Database-Implemented/tree/baseline)

This branch contains a starting point for implementing authentication and database with Next.js 13. It is a bare-bones Next.js 13 project with Tailwind CSS and ShadCn set up, including a basic layout and a few components. It also contains a few basic pages, including a signin and a signup page, but also a configuration for Prettier, TypeScript, and ESLint.

This branch features a Next.js 13 starter with Next-Auth authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and a PostgreSQL database hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech). The database connection is facilitated through [Prisma](https://prisma.io) version 5, which is compatible with serverless architecture. Additionally, OAuth authentication is configured for both GitHub and Google. The setup includes email verification and password reset functionality, implemented with the help of [Resend](https://resend.com) and [React Email](https://react.email/). This project is written in TypeScript and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [ShadCn](https://shadcn.com).
